# [Personal Website](https://tunguyenthaison.github.io/)

The [`docs`](/docs) folder contains the website located at [`https://tunguyenthaison.github.io/`](https://tunguyenthaison.github.io/). 

This website is designed using [`Ivy`](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ivy/dev/index.html), a minimalistic Python static web generator. 
All contents are written in `Markdown` or [`Syntext`](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/syntext/master/). 
The theme for this website is based on the build-in `graphite` theme that comes with `Ivy` with some modifications:

* Support for LaTeX has been added using both:
  * `KaTex`, based on [`markdown_katex`](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-katex/). 
  * `MathJax`, based [`MathJax 3`](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v3.2-latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html). 
  Equations can be written using inline math or code block. 
  * `Katex`: $`x^2`$
  * `MathJax`: $x^2$.
